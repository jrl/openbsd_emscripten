Emscripten is a source-to-source compiler that runs as a back end
to the LLVM compiler and produces a subset of JavaScript known as
asm.js. It can also produce WebAssembly. This allows applications
and libraries originally designed to run as standard executables
to be integrated into client side web applications.
